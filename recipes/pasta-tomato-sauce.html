        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Simple pasta with tomato sauce. It's a quick and simple recipe, but it always makes me happy. Definetely one of my favourites. THis meal was the start of my cooking carreer. Everyone can make this and the ingredients are not too expensive, of course Parmeggiano can be cahnged into some other a little salty dried cheese. Perfect meal to not worry about the food and relax after a long day at work.

            <li>Spices

                    <li>salt</li>
                    <li>black pepper</li>
                    <li>parsley</li>
                    <li>rosemary</li>
                    <li>thyme</li>
                    <li>sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put water into a pot with some salt and olive oil, when it starts to boil, put the pasta in the pot.</li>
            <li>Chop the onion</li>
            <li>Crush and chop the garlic</li>
            <li>Heat up a little olive oil in the pan to medium heat and throw the onion in. Fry it for 3 minutes mixing sometimes.</li>
            <li>Throw in the garlic and fry everything for 1 more minute. Mix sometimes</li>
            <li>Throw in the tomtatoes in the pan, turn the heat to high. Add a little water from the pasta. Mix everything continuously until the sauce reaches desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Just before finishing with the sauce, throw the spices. Everytime I am making it I put different amounts so there are no constants in this matter, just make sure to taste and remember what was to much or too tittle from the the last time you made this.</li>
            <li>After the pasta is cooked completely and the sauce is ready, strain the pasta and put them into the sauce. Mix everything and drizzle a little olive oil on top.</li>
            <li>Serve after it gets a little colder, sprinkle a healthy amount of parmeggiano cheese.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
