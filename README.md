This is the recipes project. The first one following the Odin project course on Javascript. It will be a simple recipe website with a homepage, couple recipes and an about section.

After a couple of recipes I've decided to put this recipe book project in the waiting list. While making it I realized that this would be a very good project for my own website and for myself, to gather ideas when I am cooking. My idea is to expand this recipe book into a full online recipe repository with categories, recipes for different events, everything ,of course, beautifully designed and intuitive. But for all of that I need more skills and knowledge, so that is why this recipe book will have to wait.

So far this project taught me:
  Html boiler plate is in my head now.
  A lot of useful practice with terminal and git commands.
  another realisation of how much I still have to learn to build a modern webpage, which would be at least acceptable to look at
  How to put images and links with absolute and relative paths.

So far only 2 recipes(1 normal one) made.
This will be a long jorney.
